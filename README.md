# What I learnt

I learnt how to use the firt utility-class framework approach with Tailwind.
As I have the fundamentals of CSS and also had used regular CSS for a long time,
and with the awesome explanations given by the teacher, the tutorial was easy
to learn and grasp its fundamentals and mechanics.
